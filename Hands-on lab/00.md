## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section _before_ taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time.

### Task 1: Create the Project Repo

In this task, you will create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com) and use `git` to add lab files to a new repository.

1. In a new browser tab open ```https://www.github.com``` and Log in with your personal GitHub account.

    > **Note** : You have to use your own GitHub account. If you don't have a GitHub account then navigate to the following link ```https://github.com/join``` and create one.
    
1. In the upper-right corner, expand the user drop down menu and select **Your repositories**.

   ![The user menu is expanded with the Your repositories item selected.](https://github.com/anushabc/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps/blob/prod/Hands-on%20lab/media/image04.png?raw=true "User menu, your repositories")

1. Next to the search criteria, locate and select the **New** button.

   ![The GitHub Find a repository search criteria is shown with the New button selected.](https://github.com/anushabc/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps/blob/prod/Hands-on%20lab/media/image05.png?raw=true "New repository button")

1. On the **Create a new repository** screen, name the repository ```mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files```, select **Private** and click on **Create repository** button.

   >Note: If you have done this lab in previous you may have the repositry already created in your GitHub account, Please make sure the delete the Repo and create a new one. 

1. On the **Quick setup** screen, copy the **HTTPS** GitHub URL for your new repository, paste this in notepad for future use.

   ![Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](media/image26.png "Quick setup screen")

2. In your Labvm open a Powershell Terminal and run the below commands to clone the lab repository.

   - Create an appropriate workspace folder and navigate to it in a PowerShell terminal.

     ```pwsh
     C:
     mkdir C:\Workspaces
     cd C:\Workspaces
     mkdir lab
     cd lab
     ```

   - Type the following command and press `<ENTER>`:

     ```pwsh
     git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps.git
     ```

   - Create a folder for the GitHub repository created in Step 1 and navigate to it in PowerShell.

     ```pwsh
     mkdir mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
     cd mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
     ```

   - Copy lab files from the MCW lab repository to the new folder.

     ```pwsh
     Copy-Item '..\mcw-continuous-delivery-in-azure-devops\Hands-on lab\lab-files\*' -Destination ./ -Recurse
     ```
     
   - Set your username and email, which git uses for commits. Make sure to replace your email and username.
   
     ```pwsh
     git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
     git config --global user.name "Your UserName"
     ```
     
    - Initialize folder as a git repository, commit, and submit contents to remote GitHub branch `main` in the lab files repository created in Step 1. Make sure to replace `<your_github_repository-url>` with the value you copied in step 5.

      > **Note**: The URI of the lab files GitHub repository created in Step 1 will differ from that in the example below.

      ```pwsh
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      git branch -M main
      git remote add origin <your_github_repository-url>
      git push -u origin main
      ```
      
    - After running the above commands, you will be prompted with a pop-up window to sign-in into the GitHub. Select **Sign in with your Browser** on the pop-up window.

   - If you are re-directed to the Git Credential Manager page, sign in into the GitHub using your personal GitHub account credentials.
